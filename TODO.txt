registering a second time crashes bot
riot games api needs regenerating
im about to try and make the matchmaking algorithm for my bot. basically its going to be done by converting ranks into a number ie iron 4 = 1 and bronze 4 = 5.
ill have a pool of approx 30 ppl all reacting to the same bot. i want to make balanced teams 



take the highest player and the second highest player and place each in team one and team 2
brute force find a combination of all other players that make the closest number


pass over a dictionary of                discord id : league id
pass back a list of dictionaries of      league id  : rank


Make sure that i dont crash the bot on challenger players since they have no tier
